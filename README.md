This thesis focuses on the hyperparameter optimization problem applied on convolutional neural networks with transfer learning for image classification. 

Since the convolutional neural networks have been acknowledged as the state-of-the-art solution for image classification, several studies focused on optimizing their performances. Architecture, training, image preprocessing are only some examples of the deep learning workflow components that have been developed in order to improve the convolutional neural networks capabilities. The first chapter deals with image classification, providing an historical background and an overview of convolutional neural networks and transfer learning.


Although these paradigms are well-defined on benchmark datasets, the appli- cation of convolutional neural networks to real world examples requires still too many decisions without any a priori information about their goodness. In the deep learning context all the decisions required in the model building are referred as hyperparameters of the model and the problem of choosing the best set of hyper- paramters is known as hyperparameter optimization. The second chapter deepens this problem, discussing some techniques along with their strengths and weaknesses.
Lastly, the application of a promising hyperparamter optimization technique, BOHB, is applied to a convolutional neural network from scratch and on a transfer learning model. The resulting best model configuration is used to develop a business solution for insurance market: an automated suite for the damage detection on cars.
